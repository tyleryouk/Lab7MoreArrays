# Lab7MoreArrays

Lab 7
Working With 2D Arrays and JUnit
In this lab, you will write methods using 2D arrays test your results with JUnit

If you did not join the recitation, you need to complete the first 3 steps in task 4 (step 3 is inclusive)).

Task 1. Assigning Lab Partners
The first thing that will occur in this lab is the assigning of lab partners. The teaching assistants in the recitation will pair you with another student.

Rules For The Lab
Your grade will be determined by how well you work as a member of a team. You will play two different roles in the lab. You will either be the driver or navigator.

driver: The person typing at the keyboard.
navigator: The person watching for mistakes, making suggestions, and thinking ahead.
Important: The driver is the only one who may do the typing. The navigator must not jump in and start editing.
Choose one of you to begin as the driver. The other will be the navigator, and the lab will tell you when to switch roles.

You do not have to complete all the tasks by the end of lab, but you do have to make a good effort.
The only ways to lose points when working as a team is 1) you do not show up on time, 2) you goof off, 3) you are the navigator and you take over editing the document from the driver, or 4) you sit quietly as the navigator and never offer suggestions.

Submitting the Lab
At the end of lab, submit your program. Both you and your lab partner should submit your code. Remember that your code is in a file with a .java extension, and depending on your browser, the extension may or may not be visible. Do not submit the file with the .class extension (that is Java bytecode) or the .java~ extension (that is a temporary editor file).

If you are a novice programmer, your goal is to complete at least at least the first three methods of the lab in the task 4. If you have not completed the second method and there is less than 15 minutes left in the lab, please ask one of the lab assistants for help.

Task 2. Introductions and Starting DrJava
Tell your lab partner your name as well whether you like to study in quiet places or noisy places.

Choose one of you to start as the driver, and launch DrJava.

Task 3. Using JUnit
Download both the Array2Lab.java file and the Array2LabTester.java file. Load them in DrJava and compile them.

The Array2Lab.java file has a bunch of methods that do practically nothing. Your task in this lab is to get as many of these methods working as you can.

The Array2LabTester.java file has methods to test the methods of Array2Lab.java using the JUnit testing package. These methods have been created for you in this lab. You can run these tests by clicking the Test button at the top of DrJava.

Task 4. Writing and Testing Your Code
First, place you name and your lab partner's name at the top of the Array2Lab.java file.

Step 1: Write the contains method and test it using the Test button until the test for contains is green.

You are not to modify the Array2LabTester.java test cases for the contains method.

The comment above each method explains what the method should do. The Precondition is a statement that describes what you can assume will be true about the parameters to the method. The Postcondition statement lists something that, if your code is correct, will be true when the method returns.

Switch roles, the driver should navigate and the navigator should drive.

Step 2: Write the arrayToString method and test it using the Test button.

Demonstrate your method and show your test case to the lab assistant.

Switch roles, the driver should navigate and the navigator should drive.

Step 3: Write the transpose method and test it using JUnit.

Switch roles, the driver should navigate and the navigator should drive.

Step 4: Write the removeRowAndCol method and test it using JUnit.

Task Last. Finishing Up
Once completed, submit your Array2Lab.java file. Remember that both you and your lab partner should submit this file.
